Copy the contents of
the extracted release to your root Ja2 directory , in my case
"C:\Program Files\TalonSoft\Ja2". You may notice a neat little blank
file named "NoIntro.txt"... i found out about this while looking
through the source for a way to disable the video cut scenes, and what
do you know, it's allready implemented ! :)</div>

Don't think you can
skip this step, there's too much in here which needs independently
configuring per client to achieve successfull connection and gameplay.<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will find a copy of this file with
the release,
this needs to go in your root Ja2 directory, along with the .exe
included. It contains all the variables and parameters i have added
which are convenient to change. They are read in from the file as part
of starting up the Raknet Client. So if you change a setting in the
file, you dont need to restart the game engine for effect, simply
restart the net client. More&nbsp;about these variables in the
following section where i detail each one.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is now the
first step after starting a new game and choosing initial game option, and is only done by the server,
client changes have no effect. This cannot be changed once server
started/running.&nbsp; <br>


<br>


&nbsp; Switch
to the Airspace display by either clicking on the map button or
pressing the 'A' key. Then click on the 'bullseye' to select it, (which
will at startup be located at secotor 9,1 "Omerta"), then place it as
the agreed/desired game sector. All hired Mercs and Bobby Rays orders
will now be sent there.</div>

Ok... start a new
game and when presented with the map screen, press the '1' key, (it
works on the numpad too). You should see some little remarks about the
server starting up.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you are the host
you need to connect to your server to play, do this after starting it
as above by pressing the '2' key. If you aren't the host, start a new
game with the same settings as the host, and once at the map screen,
press the '2' key. In either situation you should see some comments
about the Raknet network client starting up, and then if you have
specified the right variables in Ja2_mp.ini and your network/firewall
is "ok",&nbsp;you should make connection and see report of this
from
both the server and client. If you need to change a variable in your
config or simply have another go at connecting, you can press the '2'
key again after your attempt has been reported as failed, or kill the
client/server and start it again.<br>

<br>


<h3 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="Hiring_you_Mercs"></a>Hiring you Mercs</h3>


<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all clients are connected
and only then should you start hiring mercs, when the server is ready,
they press the '3' key to unlock the laptop access.

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Boot up your laptop
and hire up-to 7 Mercs from the selections at AIM and MERC... Due to
the assumed fact that their proceeding action wont be longer than a
day, the default chosen contract length, delivery time and confirmation
have been adjusted for ease of use.<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might also add here that this can be a
good time
to save the game, once all clients have hired their mercs, this way if
there is a crash or some other problem or you just want to start again
or play once more, you can do so quicker. Though bobby rays orders are
not save at the moment, so save before placing them.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just had to add
this in because i could ;p ... the default destination and shipping
choice have been pre-set, and there's no difference in changing them.
<br>


<br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delivery is now made immediately after order,
and available from the map inventory screen, without loading the level
!, into
your pre-located crate as specified in the config file. Further orders
can be made mid game. Note
i've changed the defualt game options to gives the best bobby rays
selection, this is great, unless you want it otherwise.<br>

When all clients
have followed the above steps and are ready for battle, from the map
screen, press the '3' key. When all clients are ready, this will load
the level and launch the&nbsp;"Tactical Placement GUI", as known
by the overhead map view of the sector, allowing placement of Mercs
along allocated edge space once all clients are loaded.</div>




<h3 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="Placing_you_Mercs"></a>Placing your Mercs</h3>




<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all clients are loaded you can begin. *Be carefull if for some
reason you will be placing opposed mercs along the same edge or at a
corner where they may be in immediate sighting range of another clients
enemy merc edge, you will probably have problems, as the code doesn't
like starting the battle (going into tactical) and going straight into
turnbased mode when all clients aren't in tactical yet, ie still in
placement mode.</div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When all clients
have finished with their merc placement and are ready, all can selet
"Done". This will set you as "ready" unless you cancel, and when all are ready itwill go into what is called "Tactical View". It
will start in realtime until the the first opposed sighting is made at
which time it changes to turn-based mode and at this stage of
development doesn't come back until all but one team is left.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

Let me break it to
you now so as to dash those hopes you had of experiencing the full
spectrum of intricacy and complexity afforded by the Ja2 engine but in
Multiplayer...<br>




<br>




Very little of the combat components have been implemented at this
stage... here is the list of what is sent across the network and as
such justifies allowed gameplay manouvers:<br>




<br>




** moving your mercs on the ground level, ** changing stance between
standing, crouching, and prone, ** changing facing direction,
&nbsp;**
firing a gun, ** bullet damages and ** stopping a merc apon spotting
new enemy...<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I might also mention that ** knife
damages,&nbsp;**
punch damages, ** and burst fire damages are implemented, however the
animations are not. This leaves pretty much all the rest of the fun
un-implemented, so agree to avoid it to save confusion and invalid
battle actions, for example, roofs, med packs,&nbsp; and grenades
etc.
etc.<br>

Once all but one
team is left we have a winner, and you will either be presented with
notification of defeat or, be returned to realtime and as such become
the winner / survivor.<br>




From here im not sure whatis possible, you could obviously start a new
game, but you could also try hiring more mercs and gear, which will be
delivered automatically. Perhaps even the survivor could walk to
another sector, and those defeated, hiring more weapons and mercs could
change their destination sector. Though it hasnt been tested...<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seems to have nutted out the problem
stopping my
initial sometimes working attempt from working all the time. it was
that the Inv array part of the Merc Create struct , which is a class
and not that simple, was getting mangled through the RPC call, so i
fixed it by pulling out the inventory items into a dedicated struct to
hold them and the old struct, passing this, and then at the other end
(the recieve) a new create merc struct is initiated, and filled with
values from the old struct, (the bits that pass through ok), and the
pulled out inventory items passed through "outside" with it.<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to work out, so let me know if
you have any
experience to comment on. The AI components are now set server side
only. And are sent out when the server creates them, which is generally
after going from the tactical placement gui, into the tactical "action"
view.
<h3 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="Further_Development"></a>Further Development</h3>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At times ive been quite lost at the
approach at
which i have been tackling this... there are/is alot of information
changes and happening under the surface that it is almost impossible to
make individual calls and recieves for each, though technically
possible, particularly if you only take it one at a time. But ive
become more interested in a possiblility which has been talked about a
bit on the forums where there is a central game running on a server and
the clients simply manipulate that. It means going to a deeper level of
the core game engine platform than ive been working with but it would
hae it benifits. Allready ive gotten into the side of things which
handles input, that is rather straight forward, so you could
theoretically have each client take a turn at having their commands via
the keyboard/mouse sent and activated on the central server game
instance. Easy enough. <br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bit im not sure on is how you'd have
each client
seeing they're own realtime independant view, as different client would
have different viewports. perhaps you could stream the video / directx
layer, but that may be a bit much like VNC and not necessary to have so
much data being sent. More recently ive been hopefull of the
possibility of sending out to the clients the Animation calls made by
the server as it goes about the game's progress. <br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So aside from this inspiration for total
overhall im
not totally abondoning this branch, as its still become/ing something
that can be played and offers gameplay un-experienced before. Im still
keen on implementing more combat features and am keen for suggestions
through the Bear's Pit Forum thread relating to this release. If people
suggest say 5 to 10 of there most wanted implementations, i can do a
few of the possible candidates. Some im keen on are, roof actions,
grenades, med packs, items and &nbsp;Co-Op.<br>

<h3 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="How_it_all_Works"></a>How it all Works</h3>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you dont want to get your head
under the bonet
and into the code itself just yet but are just interested to know how i
went about certain things, here's a brief run down. <br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well firslty i hope it does work,
atleast some for
you, ive barely play tested, just loading it up on my spare computer
which is a laptop with no screen and a damaged faulty monitor output
plug, enough though that i could test my code worked, but iver
christmas i hope to test it further, perhaps you can to and give some
feedback.<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the Initial Server and Client
components
which i transfered and modified from a "Chat Example" project that
comes with RakNet. I used a function of RakNet called RPC or Remote
Procedure Calls to send and recieve my communication. This is easy as
it avoid having to package my data into packets, send it, then open it
at the other end and work out what to do with it. An RPC function
simply executes the function specified on the other specified remote
clients, in this case all but the sender.<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The server computer lets each
client/side know when
its there turn and the clients tell the server when they've finished
they're's. When a client give the fire weapon order, an inital command
is sent out to all the other clients telling them to do the same.
Except when the other clients get to the bit of code which applies the
hit and damage, if the command came from another Client they stop. Then
when the Original client works out the hit damage taking into
consideration random factors, and if it happened, and sends it out to
all the other clients which then apply it hopefully in time to make it
all seem connected.... You will notice wont short-coming of this, is
that a client having recieved an order to replicate a weapon firing,
may do so, but calculate that this particaular shot is going to miss,
and such show the difference in arc for the bullet animation to miss,
but just as you see the bullet whizzing past your head, you recieve the
second command from the attacking client (the one which has the bullet
hitting and it's damages) ... this is then applied and your on half
health after breathing what was in this case, a too eager sigh of
relief ... and the same example vice versa .<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the few other implemented
commands, the are pretty simple and straight forward...<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much of the time i've been looking
through the
code and i would find things that were almost perfectly set up for
multiplayer and often not used at all, there was a definate effort by
the original creators and they came close in my opinion... id love to
know what stopped them... ?<br>




<br>




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now another of the new systems
implemented is
the 4 new LAN teams (bteam: 6, 7, 8, and 9). How i did this was to have
4 new teams, 1 for wach client, max at 4. when client 1 hires a merc
for example it is sent out and spawned on the other clients in team 6.
client 2 in 7, client 3 in 8 and 4 in 9. The server (client 1) handles
the team order and sends the command to each client to start any
particualr teams turn, including the AI. There are a set number range
of ubID's for each team: 6(client 1, the server) is 120 to 126 (7
members), on any client, their own mercs take slots 0 through 19 team
0, but when a client sends out a new move for example, the merc's ID
(ubID) is prefixed (added) with a corresponding number to their client
number (netbTeam) to match it with the network spawned merc copies in
the other games. for example any clients first merc will be ubID 0 and
team 0, if its client 1 (server) a prefix of 120 is added on to make
its ubID 120 which is the first clot for team 6 which is used to hold
the "copies" of client 1's team remotely. if its client 2, the prefix
is 127, and so on... i hope this makes things clearer ;)<br>




<br>



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interupts are working well for what i have
tested... The server handles and sends out interrupts for its own mercs
and the AI, while each client handles and sends out only their own
mercs interrupts.<br>
