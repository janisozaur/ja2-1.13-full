This is a quick setup description, how to run ja2 linux port.

I believe, that this package is stored in dir ~/lpja2.

1. Install some libs: libexpat1, libexpat1-dev, libsdl1.2, libsdl1.2-dev (for future).

2. Run in console:
	cd ~/lpja2/project/
	sh ./install_fmod.sh

This will install libfmod to your system.

3. Continue to run in console:
	make user-dir

This will create ja2-1.13 directory in your home dir and a file "resources.cfg" will be copied to this new dir.

4. Continue to run in console:
	sh ./build_release.sh

Then go drink something, you'll be free for about 10 minutes. ;)
This will compile game executable file (hopefully). It will be named as ~/lpja2/bin/release/ja2lp.
You can copy it to another place.

5. Copy Ja2.ini file and Data and Data-1.13 directories to ~/ja2-1.13.
Note, that Ja2.ini must be named exactly Ja2.ini, not Ja2.INI, not JA2.ini or JA2.INI.
Linux file-system is case sensitive. After that ~/ja2-1.13 must contain:
	Data/
	Data-1.13/
	Ja2.ini
	resources.cfg

6. Edit resources.cfg. You'll need to specify, where is all slf-files are located.
Edit parameter StdBaseDir. Unfortunately, ~/ja2-1.13 isn't work. You'll need to specify
full path. Then look at parameter StdSources. Edit game filenames, if they differ.
Or you can rename slf-files, so they match to this names in StdSources.

7. Run game executable (default: ~/lpja2/bin/release/ja2lp) from console.


NB: I cannot guarantee, that most recent revision of game directory will work with this exe.
Personally, I am using rev.734 of game data.
