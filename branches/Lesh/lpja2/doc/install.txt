This is a quick description of how to install the ja2 linux port.  This
document assumes that this package is stored in ~/lpja2.

1. Install some libs: libexpat1, libexpat1-dev, libsdl1.2, libsdl1.2-dev (for 
the future).  Just use whatever your distro normally supports for new system 
software, e.g., apt, yum, etc.

2. Enter the following in a console:

	cd ~/lpja2/project/
	sudo sh ./install_fmod.sh

This will install libfmod to your system.  If you forget to run under sudo, the script will remind you.

3. Enter into the console:
	make user-dir

This will create ja2-1.13 directory in your home dir, and a file
called "resources.cfg" will be copied to this new dir.

4. Enter into the console:
	sh ./build_release.sh

Then go drink something, you'll be free for about 10 minutes. ;)
This will compile the game executable file (hopefully). It will be named
~/lpja2/bin/release/ja2lp.  You may safely copy it to another place.

5. Copy the file Ja2.ini and the Data and Data-1.13 directories to ~/ja2-1.13.
Note that Ja2.ini must be named exactly "Ja2.ini," not Ja2.INI, not JA2.ini or 
JA2.INI.  Linux is case sensitive. After that, ~/ja2-1.13 will contain:
	Data/
	Data-1.13/
	Ja2.ini
	resources.cfg

You may get these files from SVN:  

svn co -r <revision> https://<host>/source/ja2_v1.13_data/GameDir

<revision> after -r is the current revision number of the game data files the
Linux port uses.  

Visit the forums at 

http://www.ja-galaxy-forum.com/board/ubbthreads.php/ubb/showflat/Number/150445/page/1#Post150445

for the exact host name/IP address, and verify that the path hasn't changed 
while you're looking at it.

You should also read the entire thread to determine which revision of the data
files is in use.

6. Get *.slf files from the Data directory in an existing Windows installation,
and copy them to Data/ in ~/ja2-1.13.

7. Copy whole Tilecache\ directory from the Data directory in an
existing Windows installation to ~/ja2-1.13/Data/.

8. Edit resources.cfg.  You'll need to specify where all the slf files are 
located.  Edit the parameter StdBaseDir. Unfortunately, you must specify 
the full path, "~/ja2-1.13" won't work.  Then look at the parameter 
StdSources.  Change the slf filenames to match what is actually in the Data
directory, if they differ (they probably will).  Or you can rename the 
files themselves, so they match the names in StdSources.  The main 
difference will be due to case insensitivity on Windows, so the upper/lower
case mixture of the filenames is likely to differ from what's in resources.cfg.

9. Run the game executable (default: ~/lpja2/bin/release/ja2lp) from the 
console.  You can run 'ja2lp --help' to learn what command line switches 
are supported.


NB: I cannot guarantee that the most recent revision of the game data files 
will work with this exe.  Personally, I am using rev.791 of the game data, as
of the last writing of this file.  Check the forum thread above for the 
current revision number in use.
