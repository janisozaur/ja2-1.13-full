STI Editor Gimp plugin installation

Just be sure, you have installed libgimp2.0-dev and everything it will pull from repository
for this (warning! this may take up to 50mb to download).

Go to console, change to dir, where you downloaded plugin sources. Run make.

user@host:~/sti-editor$ make

It will compile and install plugin for current user (not system-wide).
