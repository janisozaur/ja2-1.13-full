Crossbows + Bolts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I whish to have a total of 3 Crossbows and 6 Bolts:
- one small Pistol Crossbow (onehand operated)
  Slot:    Small Slot, 1
- one standard sporting/hunting crossbow
  Slot:    Big Slot, 1
- one big sniper Crossbow (coolest picture)
  Slot:    Big Slot, 1

- long Bolt in Standard (gray)+ AP(red) + HEAT(orange) please take the same picture always, 
  but different color for the tip & wings. Slot Graphic should be contain a number '8'
  or a bunch of Bolt Arrows to represent a 'magazine' bundle
  Slot:    Big Slot, 1 pack of eight

- short Bolt (for Pistol Crossbow) in same Standard + AP + HEAT versions
  Slot:    Small Slot, 2 pack of 8 (so 4 pack fit in the big slot)

Pictures: I attached some preselected as ZIP File. In my eyes, the "Pistol Crossbow Mk.Viper.bmp" 
          (I just worked out the grass & box) is not bad.
          The standard/hunting one could be "Md.proslider Mk.794",
	  while the Sniper device could be taken from "Md.elite Mk.634"

	  Most of them are taken from
