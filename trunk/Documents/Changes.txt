HOW TO MERGE YOUR CHANGES IN THE LATEST SOURCE
-----------------------------------------------

- Download the latest Data, Source (both rar-files) and Changes.txt from the folder "JA2 v1.13 Latest Source" (lool at the date of the folder).
- Extract both of the rar files and merge your source code and data.
	- You can use the tool "Compare It" for merging, which is located on the ftp.
- Add your changes in the Changes.txt (also add a header before the changes).
- Rar the Source and the Data.
- Create a new sub-folder in the "JA2 v1.13 Latest Source" on the ftp named with the current date (YYYY_MM_DD).
- Upload the Data, Source (both of them are rar-files) in the newly created folder.
- Upload the Changes.txt in the "JA v1.13 Latest Source" folder.
- That's it ;-)
