HOW TO MERGE YOUR CHANGES IN THE LATEST SOURCE
-----------------------------------------------

- Download the latest Data, Source (both rar-files) and Changes.txt from the folder "JA2 v1.13 Latest Source" (lool at the date of the folder).
- Extract both of the rar files and merge your source code and data.
	- You can use "Beyond Compare" or "Compare It" for merging, which are both located on the ftp.
- Add your changes in the Changes.txt (also add a header before the changes).
- Zip/Rar the Source and the Data.
- Create a new sub-folder in the "JA2 v1.13 Latest Source" on the ftp named with the current date (YYYY_MM_DD).
- Upload the Data, Source (both of them are rar-files) in the newly created folder.
- Upload the Changes.txt in the "JA v1.13 Latest Source" folder.
- That's it ;-)

- Restored the "accurate" and "inaccurate" strings that Rowa21 overwrote ;) 
- Added code to use the Accuracy tag in Weapons.xml
- IMP.dat file changed to save a different file for each IMP
- Different existing IMPs can be loaded by typing their names in the IMP webpage
- Reverted changes to font.cpp due to Ivan's text not being displayed properly
- Added an AutoPenalty stat to Weapons.xml to complement BurstPenalty
- Added a NoSemiAuto stat to Weapons.xml to enable weapons that are Full-Auto only, code also added for AI to not use NoSemiAuto weapons in semi-auto mode
- Added an APBonus stat to Items.xml to enable items to give you an APBonus/Penalty (ie: heavy armour)
- Added code to enable the AimBonus and ToHitBonus stats to be read in from worn gear
- Added Lesh's burst sound externalization code, added SilencedBurstSound tag to weapons.xml
- Changed required camouflage amount to show merc as camo'd to 50%, due to some new items affecting the camouflage %
- Added two new Merge options: Use_Item (6) and Use_Item_Hard (7), which enable the use of a single item on another single item.  The hard one performs a mechanics check.  Use_Item_Hard can be used for caliber conversion kits, etc. (But I need to add code to dump the old ammo still).  
-   Use_Item can be used for things like opening your bullets up w/a knife to empty out some of the powder, for cold-loaded ammo.  To Do: enable deterioration of the using item, figure out a way to enable multiple resultant items.
- Commented out all the Air Strike code.
- Changed the air strike options to be: "tons of guns" and "10 tons of guns"
- Used the BigGunList stat in Items.xml to determine whether items can show up depending on the selection from #9
- Completely redid all the existing weapons' stats (and a couple images).
- Changed some weapons' calibers, such as the SVD dragunov to 7.62x54r and the Type-85 to 7.62x25mm.  Eliminated some types of ammo that do not exist (at least according to my source - so correct me if this is wrong and I'll add them back in): HP ammo in 7.62x39mm, 5.45mm, and 5.7mm.
- Moved most of the old 1.13 specific weapons around in Items.xml to new spots.  The items.xml file now goes to over 1000 (w/some "nothing" entries for organization)
- Kept all the UB weapons, and some new weapons/items inside the old 350 item limit, so they can be assigned using ProEdit.  To Do: Alter the binary files so pro-edit can see the right item names.
- Throwing knife code changed, so that we can have more than one type of throwing knife.  For now, this means that tossing your knife into the dirt won't un-bloody it.  To Do: fix this later.
- New weapon sounds (swiped from various mods) TODO: Incorporate Corpse's new weapon sounds
- Reinstated 5% to-hit bonus for using a pistol w/two hands (nothing in offhand) and 5% to-hit penalty for using an SMG w/one hand (this one might've already been in, I forget) that the devs commented out
- On top of those items added to 1.13 already, I've added/am in the process of adding:

200+ new guns,
30+ new grenades,
9+ new grenade launchers,
4 new rocket launchers,
8 new knives,
a new throwing knife,
2 new armour attachments,
50+ new armours,
10+ new misc. items,
6+ new weapon attachments,
15+ new ammo calibers & 12+ new types of ammo (including cold-loaded variants)

- resulting in 240+ new ammo items, and I'm probably missing stuff
- Not all the images are in yet - will add as I get them done.
