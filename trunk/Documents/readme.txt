                                  ===========
                                  JA2 v. 1.13
                                  ===========

We started with the C++ CVS code that DeFrog so wisely ported over to
C++.NET. We've located and fixed some bugs in the original and CVS code (as well
as our own), and added a host of new features and improvements, including:

- Configurable High Resolution Graphics (1024x768, 800x600, 640x480)

- Smarter, more cunning AI that climbs on roofs and snipes using spotters

- Externalised, editable data for weapons, items, and more

- Virtually unlimited slots for new weapons, ammo, armor and other items

- New item and weapon attributes, such as thermal vision and to-hit bonuses

- New game options and modes and externalized game settings

- A slew of new gameplay features and improvements

- Weapons and ammo from UB, plus lots of new weapons, ammo and attachments

- Automatic grenade launchers!  Reloadable RPG!

- New mercs from UB now available from MERC

- UB tilesets available for user-made JA2 maps

- Just about everything is or will be configurable without hacking exe
