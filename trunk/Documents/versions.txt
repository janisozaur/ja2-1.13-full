  Build 11-08-05

- New data directory structure.  Default data (copliant with v. 1.12) is located
in the Data folder, while data specific to mod 1.13 is located in the Data-1.13
folder.  Users can make their own custom data folders and switch between them.
See install guide for more details.

- JA2 Editor (Released Seperately and still using the 10-07 code base)

- Hi-Res Version (Released as an exe patch)

- Added choosabe/random personalities and attitudes to IMP generation - see
Data-1.13\JA2_Options.ini. (For now, if you choose your attitude and
personality, it will be the same for EVERY IMP you create. The only way around
is to change the file, start the game, create an IMP, save and exit. Change the
file, reload the game, create a second IMP, save and exit, etc... -- Kaiden)

- MERC mercs can be made available on day 1 and/or make all of them available at
once (see Data-1.13\JA2_Options.ini).

- Explosive skill increase for setting and disarming mines and traps is
restored.  However, neither action succedes automatically as before: a skill
check is performed as with other explosives (it is, however, easier to disarm
your own mine/trap).

- UB tilesets add-on, which enables the use of maps using JA2 UB tilesets in
JA2.

Bug fixes:

- Busy mercs no longer assigned to squads when no mercs free in sector, except
when an air strike occurs.  Can remove mercs from all assigned squads (to fix
this bug when it happened in an older version) by pressing ctrl+alt+s.

- Various airstrike-related fixes.

- "Ghost Squads" have been fixed.

- Snipers can no longer fire without a spotter (AI fix).

- Fixed a bug that caused wisdom to improve too fast when picking locks.

  Builds prior to 11-08-05
======================================================================

This project builds upon the Whitehat CVS project ported to C++ by DeFrog, and
includes all of its new features and fixes, including variable length autofire
and chance-to-hit indicator.


AI changes:
-----------

- Enemies can now snipe you if they have a sniper scope, even if you're out
of visual range, but still visible to another enemy (spotter)

- Enemies can now climb on roofs. Sometimes they will stay up there and
snipe you.

- Enemies will now flank your position

- Enemies no longer get up and charge straight at you after dropping prone

- Enemies take cover more often

- Enemes can use suppression fire to try send you to the ground and make you
lose APs (but not out of visual range)

- AI tweaks to reduce the number of enemies on the roofs, and make snipers
only shoot when they might actually hit you

- Enemies should be less likely to come looking for you than in previous
versions. This should reduce the huge, immediate carnage upon entering a
sector, and provide more smaller battles instead.

- Enemies can use the new GL bursts

tiles, same as SMGs) (configurable)

Other new and improved features:
--------------------------------

More enemies, more frequent and aggressive attacks on towns, more elites,
higher level enemies, more frequent bursts from enemies, less starting cash

- Insane has 50% more elites than expert
- Expert has 25% more elites than normal, and 20% larger garrisons, with not
just yellow shirts

We were nice and kept the elites out of Omerta

- 5000 item slots!  New items, including weapons, ammo, and armor, can be added
in Items.xml.

- Bobby Ray's sells more stuff, both quantity and variety

New option at start: Bobby Ray Selection

BR's now sells ALL the weapons and ammo in the game, along with detonators,
TNT, etc. We also bumped grenades & explosives back a bit so you'll see them
earlier.

The following options are available:

Normal - as original
Great - 2x as much inventory as normal and sells gear a bit earlier. If you
look in the used section, you might find some slightly better stuff there,
if you're up to fixing it.
Excellent - Great, plus has 4x as much inventory as normal and sells gear a
lot earlier
Awesome - Great, plus has 10x as much inventory as normal and sells all gear
from the beginning

- Bobby Ray and Tony both sell new weapons and ammo; B.R also sells explosives
(configurable)

- Scrapped the platinum mode and moved the Realistic/Sci-Fi choice down to the
Iron Man / Regular Saves part of the screen. Iron Man is no longer
available.

- New option in preferences: Enemy equipment drops - Normal and Everything
(shortcut key = shift+D)

Obviously, if you select everything, enemies will always drop their weapons
and ammo, along with some other gear. This replaces the tons of guns option,
which is now on by default.

- Enemies can and will use new weapons

So don't be surprised if you get hit by a .50 Cal in the chest.

Enemies can use G11 and P90, and the other good guns (but only rarely)

(Configurable in EnemyGunChoices.xml)
(Enemy gear configurable in EnemyItemChoices.xml)

- Brothel re-enabled

But I couldn't get the payment thing to work properly (I'd pay and she'd let
me in and then they'd attack me  but I didn't really try _that_ hard), so
just speak friendly to the Madame and she'll let you in, and you can get the
winking smiley (and sound fx) as per pre-gold versions.

- Zero stats are trainable (configurable)

- All stats are trainable up to 100

- No loyalty penalty for inactivity

- Prof1.dat - Prof4.dat

Extra prof.dat files for Easy(1) through Insane(4) difficulty. (currently
all the same)

- The extended ear shows the enemy location in all modes, not just Platinum.

- autofire shots slow down a bit when the firing enemy is off-screen.

- Fallback animation added. Now enemies can fall backwards when they die.

- Multiple Interrupts. So now if you pass on your first chance, you can
have another.

- Audible warnings using a previously unused merc quote when enemy tanks
or rocket launchers are present

- Maximum Tilesets is now 255, with no additional code changes required to
add new tilesets. (UB Tileset add-on Pack Available for Download)

- GL Burst cursor-type toggle option in preferences screen (also shift-G)

- Laser scopes now operate most effectively at a certain range, decreasing
their bonus beyond that and don't operate as well in bright light.

- Item bonuses scale better with item status

- time-of-day-dependent vision bonuses scale better with time of day

- Air Strikes

2 types: random when too many mercs are located in one sector, and
radioed-in by enemies during combat

(can be toggled on/off when starting a new game)

- UB style reveal all enemy gear when sector cleared


Interface Changes:
------------------

- Control + LMB on map inventory screen to permanently delete items w/out
confirming

- Alternate + LMB on map inventory screen to sell items to the locals for
25% of their value w/out confirming (configurable)

- Ctrl-D turns ON/OFF the Enemy's Drop All option


JA2_Options.ini File
--------------------

- Basic settings externalized, including starting cash, enemy difficulty and
numbers, militia numbers and cost of training.

- Turn random IMP Personalities and Attitudes ON/OFF or pick and choose your
own attitude and personality.

- Make the MERC Website available at the beginning of the game.

- Option to allow all Mercs from MERC available as soon as the website is
available.


IMP changes:
------------

- Multiple IMPs & 90210 code re-enabled

- UB Style IMP generation screens

- IMP items configurable in xml; includes options for random items and items
for any stat/specialty.

- IMP clothing colours vary by portrait

- It is now possible to drop leadership to Zero.

- Adjusted the IMP male body selection so that it allows you to have a large
body, regardless of portrait, and won't replace your martial arts skills
w/HTH, but rather just give you a smaller body.


Rebalanced stat gains:
----------------------

The main idea here is that skills that affect the outcome of merc actions should
be the same skills that are improved.

- More dex. and wis. for healing

- Wisdom is awarded for training militia, training other mercs, practising
skills, detecting land mines, making combos and special attachments and
attaching detonators, and picking locks.  Most of the increases depend on the
difficulty of the task.

- Mercs training other mercs gain leadership

- In hand-to-hand attacks stats increase in proportion to their use.  Punching
and knifing: 3*dex + 1*agi + 1*str, stealing: 1*dex + 1*agi + 3*str.

- Grenade throwing gives str., dex. and mrk.

- Exertion (spending energy through moving and other activities) adds some
health and strength.


Weapons and ammo from Unfinished Business
-----------------------------------------

We added the following weapons (in addition to the regular JA2 guns):

- Barrett .50 Cal Sniper Rifle
- H&K PSG1 Sniper Rifle

- Calico M960A SMG

All stats are the same as in UB, except for the Calico M950, to which I
added burst-fire. (A pistol that big, with a 50-round magazine without burst
fire just seemed a waste to me)

- Autofire now has same penalty as burst after the first bullet

body.
