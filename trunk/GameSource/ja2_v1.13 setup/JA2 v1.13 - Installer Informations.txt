The folder "JA2 v1.13 Setup" must be placed on your hard disk on the same folder level like the "GameDir" folder from SVN.
Otherwise the links to the game data (coded in the setup-project files) files will not be found, when trying to build the projects from VS .NET.

Example of the folder structure:

C:\
	- Build
	- GameDir		(-> same folder level like "JA2 v1.13 Setup")
	- Tools
	- JA2 v1.13 Setup	(-> same folder level like "GameDir")
		- Complete v1.13
		- Data
		- ...

If any of the files in "GameDir" changes (or new files are added or deleted) you must update the references
for each file (from the GameDir) of the respective project in the solution.

The solution of the installer contains the following packages:

*****************************************************************************************************************
*		NAME				*	SIZE	* 		CONTAINING DATA			*						
*****************************************************************************************************************
JA2 v1.13 - Complete (All-In-One).msi			164 MB	  All the v1.13 GameDir including Loadscreens, Speech, Weapon Sounds, ...) -> ALL-IN-ONE!
JA2 v1.13 - Data.msi					 11 MB	  All the v1.13 GameDir, excluding Weapon Sounds, Speech, Optional Loadscreens (but the main menu background image!)	
JA2 v1.13 - Optional Loadscreens.msi			 21 MB	  The optional Loadscreens (Data\Loadscreens), but without the main menu background image	
JA2 v1.13 - Weapon Sounds (Part 1).msi			 28 MB	  Data-1.13\Sounds\Weapons (Single Shots & up to 15 burst rounds)	
JA2 v1.13 - Weapon Sounds (Part 2).msi			 37 MB	  Data-1.13\Sounds\Weapons (16 to 30 burst rounds)	
JA2 v1.13 - Weapon Sounds (Part 3).msi			 55 MB	  Data-1.13\Sounds\Weapons (31 to 50 burst rounds)
JA2 v1.13 - Speech.msi					 18 MB	  Data\Speech	

The folder "JA2 v1.13 Setup" contains a subfolder named "Support". This folder contains the *.rtf files, JA2-Icon, Images for the Splash Screens, ....
The *.rtf files are displayed after the splash screen of the installer package. 
These files should contain some informations of the installer package (Todo!!).

To add any new files to the setup-projects (in Visual Studio .NET), you must do the following:
- Select the setup-project in the solution explorer
- Open the file system editor
- Select the "Application Folder" and then browse to the folder where you like to add some files
- Click "Add -> File". Then browse in the "GameDir" folder and select the file(s) you like to add.

To build the installation package (*.msi), select the project and then "Build". 
If you click "Build" on the solution file, all the setup-projects are going to be build.

HINT: The project "JA2 v1.13 - Complete (All-In-One)" takes some minutes to be build (-> so take a coffee or two  :-) ...)
